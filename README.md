# Flight Registry

## About
This program stimulates a simple flight scheduling software. This program takes passenger name inputs and determines
the remaining number of flight seats available for booking.

As of now, the flight seat capacity is held constant (at 4 seats). 

## Future Considerations
In the future, I would like to implement this program to *only* accept string inputs for the passenger names. 
I would also consider adding more complex features such as hotel reservations/prices.
