# Flight Registry ✈️

This program stimulates a simple flight scheduling software. This program takes passenger name inputs and determines the remaining number of flight seats available for booking.

As of now, the flight seat capacity is held constant (at 4 seats). 

## Future Improvements 📈 
In the future, I'd like to implement this program to *only* accept string inputs for the passenger names. I'd also consider adding more complex features such as hotel reservations/prices.
